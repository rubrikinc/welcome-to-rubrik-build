## Code Reviews

All changes must be code reviewed. For non-maintainers this is obvious, since you can't commit anyway. But even for maintainers, all code changes should receive at least one review, preferably (for non-trivial changes obligatorily) from someone who knows the areas the change touches.

For non-trivial changes, multiple reviewers may be assigned. The primary reviewer will make this decision and nominate a second reviewer, if needed. If a maintainer intends to be the primary reviewer of a PR they should set themselves as the assignee on GitHub, then reply to the PR and specify so. However, only the primary reviewer of a change should conduct the merge, except in rare cases.

If a PR has gone 2 work days without an owner emerging, please poke the PR thread and ask for a reviewer to be assigned.

Except for rare cases, such as trivial changes (e.g. typos, comments) or emergencies (e.g. broken builds), maintainers should not merge their own changes.

Expect reviewers to request that you follow the PR template.

## Assigned Reviews

Maintainers can assign reviews to other maintainers, when appropriate. The assignee manages that PR and is responsible for merging or closing the PR once ready. The assignee may request reviews from non-maintainers.
