# Pull Request Submission

Pull Requests (PRs) are used by individuals who wish to contribute to a project. The high level workflow is as follows:

* Individual creates a Fork of a Rubrik Build project to their own GitHub account.
* Individual makes changes to the Fork copy of the project.
* Individual submits a PR requesting that the Rubrik Build project “pull in” their changes.

When receiving a PR, it is important that a member of the Rubrik Build team acknowledge and review the changes to ensure they are beneficial in nature.

|**Note:** Changes can potentially be made to any data held within a project, including documentation, source code, images, and so forth.|

## PR Submission Template
Each repository will contain a [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) file in the `.github` folder. This is a special folder that will insert a form, written in markdown, into the start of a new pull request. The user submitting the pull request then follows the form to ensure all necessary information has been gathered for review of the changes.

## PR Requirements
At a minimum, individuals who submit a PR must meet the following requirements:

1. Have an associated Issue that describes the need for change.
2. Have completed a comprehensive form that is displayed when creating the PR.
3. Have signed the commits held within the PR for authenticity.

## PR Guidance
Guidance should be offered to those looking to submit a PR. Help us review your PRs more quickly by following these guidelines:

1. Try not to touch a large number of files in a single PR if possible.
2. Don't change whitespace or line wrapping in parts of a file you are not editing for other reasons. Make sure your text editor is not configured to automatically reformat the whole file when saving.
