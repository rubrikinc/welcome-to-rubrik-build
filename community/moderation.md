- Check the [centralized list of administrators]/community/moderators.md] for contact information.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of the Build community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all Build official channels.

Moderators _MUST_:

- Take action as specified by these Moderator Guidelines.
  - You are empowered to take _immediate action_ when there is a violation. You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious violation has occurred. Make a judgement call based on our [Code of Conduct](/Code-of-Conduct.md). 
  - Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let it sit there.
- Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators.
- Ensure that the [Code of Conduct](/Code-of-Conduct.md) is in effect on all official communication channels.
- Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for moderation.
  - This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of people to allow for absences/travel.
  - Ensure you are on #slack-admins during work hours and notifications are set appropriately.
- Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by removing a member from that resource.
- Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential multiple cultural differences between community members.
- Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers, and other users via private email or a direct message.
- Report violations of the Code of Conduct to <build@rubrik.com>.

Moderators _SHOULD_:

- Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with other community members.
- Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having difficulty expressing comments and questions in English.
- Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases, moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact with.
- Remember to check and recognize if you need take a break when you become frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate.
- Be helpful and have fun!
