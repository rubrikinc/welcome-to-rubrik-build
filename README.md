To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to Project Governance information.

## Communicating

The [communication](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/community/communication.md) page lists communication channels like chat, issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

## Project Types

Build has three types of project:

* **Community Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by the Build community
* **Rubrik Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by Rubrik while accepting contributions from the community
* **Partner Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by a Partner and Rubrik while accepting contributions from the community

The `README.md` of each repository should designate the project type.

## Learn to Build

Links in [Learning Resources](/contributors/learn/README.md) lead to many relevant technical topics.

## Contribute

A first step to contributing is to pick an existing project or to submit an idea for a new project.

Projects will often have issues, which can be either a bug fix or enhancement request, that are labeled as `first-timer` or `exp-beginner` that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](contributors/guide/README.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:

1. How to [file an issue](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-handling.md)
1. How to [find something to work on](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/labels.md)
1. How to [open a pull request](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/submitting-pull-requests.md)
