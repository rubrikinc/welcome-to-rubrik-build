The look and feel of each published project is important. Consistency is key. All existing and new projects should contain several mandatory items, such as a Code of Conduct, templates for GitHub flow, MIT licensing, and guidelines for contributing. 

This page is intended to provide all information required to begin a new project. 

## Basics

All new and existing projects must contain the following: 

* README


* [Code of Conduct]()
* [MIT licensing](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/LICENSE)
* [Contributing  Guidelines](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* `.github` folder containing the following templates:

    * [Bug Report](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/Templates/bug-report.md) 
    * [Enhancement Request](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/Templates/enhancement_request.md)
